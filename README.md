# AdventureWorksERM
https://adventureworkserm.azurewebsites.net/  
Simple ERM like system based on AdventureWorks database (not finished)  

This project was made for my educational/training purposes.  
I used ASP.net core, EFcore, TSql db first (adventure works), TSql db code first (Microsoft Identity).  

You can find it working on Azure cloud service by link above.  
If you want to play with it, you can use this accounts:  
admin@example.com / Pa$$w0rd  
user@example.com /  Pa$$w0rd  
or create own.  
Avoid to use real email/pass, i don't need them. Thank you! Good luck!
